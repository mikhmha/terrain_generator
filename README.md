# terrain_generator
A procedural 3D terrain generator made using OpenGL and modern C++ that uses Bezier Surfaces and Perlin Noise to generate smooth terrain surfaces with variable levels of detail. The generated terrain supports dynamic tesselation during run-time via the tesselation shader.

The generated terrain surfaces can also be used in ray-tracing applications, or decomposed into extremely fine collision meshes for use in real-time collision detection systems.

**Requires:**
- A compiler that supports C++ 20
