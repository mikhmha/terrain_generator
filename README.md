# terrain_generator
A procedural 3D terrain generator made with OpenGL and modern C++ that generates terrain with variable detail and smoothness using Bezier Surfaces and Perlin Noise. The generated terrain supports dynamic tesselation during run-time using a tesselation shader.

Generated terrain surfaces can also be used in ray-tracing applications, or decomposed into extremely fine collision meshes for use in real-time collision detection systems.

**Requires:**
- A compiler that supports C++ 20
